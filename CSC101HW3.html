Business Model Canvas

•	Customer Segments: Niche market (those who like toys) and segmented (Pre-Teen boys, Gamers (all genders))
•	Value Propositions: Toy products, having an easy-to-use and highly maintained website (always having product in stock, always having the website updated, always having the newest variations of the products available on the website), always working to provide the best available price to the consumer over the competitors (making the supply chain as cost-efficient as possible), having excellent customer service and media relations, possibly having a guarantee-type of program to reduce risk to end consumer (such as satisfaction guaranteed, free returns, etc.)
•	Channels: Website (personal channel, online retail service)
•	Customer Relationships: Self-service, we market the toys on the business website and the customer goes on and services themselves by selecting the items wanted and going through the buying process (selection, checkout, payment information, etc.)
•	Revenue Streams: Selling toy products to the consumer segments
•	Key Resources: Ability to ship/deliver toy products the fastest (would be based on shipper/deliverer service), possibly retailer exclusive deals (make a deal with the supplier to ONLY have the product on your website OR even have a exclusive version of the toy sold on the website), adequate staff for technical needs like customer service and website maintenance, having a warehouse-type of operation to operate out of where all incoming items are collected and then shipped out to customers (company owned product warehouse)
•	Key Activities: Establish the most cost-efficient relationship with the supplier to get the toys at the best price possibly while retaining the appropriate quality level, always be on the lookout for other suppliers to see if they can supply the same toy product at a cheaper cost, look for the most cost-effective method of delivery to cut down shipping/delivery costs to the end consumer (toys are usually pretty rigid so shipping/delivery is more robust than say for a product that is more delicate or requires factors like refrigeration) 
•	Key Partnerships: Suppliers who can supply adequate amounts of the toy products at the appropriate price, if the suppliers don’t actually manufacture the product (maybe they just act as middle-man between you and the actual manufacturer) than establish a relationship with the actual manufacture of the toy products, shippers/delivers (postal service, UPS, especially for international operations), SEO companies that can help with search engine optimization if this component is to be outsourced, partnerships with other businesses (possibly comic-book-style stores, toy shops, toy conventions, etc.)
•	Cost Structure: possibly cost-driven as the toys would not be of relatively high price value (such as luxury brands, also consider demographic of customer segment being teens & gamers (general population & adolescents)), fixed costs (website operating costs, rent (if not working out of home and having other staff), staff salaries, etc.), variable costs, utilize an economy of scale approach (as more product is purchased at a time the cost to consumer will go down)
